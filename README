A failed but fun attempt to create a game skeleton written in Go.

I did wrong and what I learned :

- don't use pixels as world coordinates
- think about a simple game logic system first
- don't have high expectations, do simple things
- tiles were not the right solution for this game

What worked :

- Ogmo scenes import (https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/#), and Ogmo is a very cool tool btw
- Dual backend windows/sdl and wasm/browser
- Staying away from OpenGl/WebGl, pure Go image buffers are fast enough for 2D games
